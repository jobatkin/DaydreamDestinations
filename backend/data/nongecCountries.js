        background:
            "The Åland Islands are located in the Baltic Sea between Finland and Sweden. They have a unique cultural identity with Swedish as the official language, reflecting their historical connection to Sweden. The islands were ceded to Russia in 1809, later becoming part of the Grand Duchy of Finland, and were granted autonomy by the League of Nations in 1921 to resolve territorial disputes. Today, Åland enjoys extensive self-governance, including its own parliament and control over many local matters",
